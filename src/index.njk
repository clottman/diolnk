        <h2>Event Details</h2>
        <p>Do-It-Ourselves Fest is one day of workshops celebrating DIY culture, art, music, and learning through mutual aid.</p>
        <p>DIO Fest is about what we can do ourselves, for ourselves and one another. Itâ€™s about what we are all capable of when we come together as one.</p>
        <p>
            We are drawing on a rich history; this is the fourth DIO Fest that has been held in Lincoln, from a small event at the Bike Kitchen in 2013, growing a bit in 2015 at the Commons, to a jam-packed 3-day event at the Bay in 2017.
            This year, we're back at the Bay, for just one day.
        </p>

            The event will primarily be taking place indoors in a wheelchair-friendly space.

However, there will be opportunities for snacks and drinks - you're welcome to step outside for those breaks if you'd like.
